# WTG 2.0 Lightweight + AutoCards Combined System

## Version: 1.0.3 Combined
Date: 2025-10-14

## Version History

### Version 1.0.3 (2025-10-14)
**Feature: Automatic Storycard [settime] Detection at Scenario Start**

**New Features**:
1. **Storycard [settime] Processing**: When a scenario first starts, the system now scans all storycards for `[settime]` commands. If found, the command is automatically processed to set the starting date and time, allowing the AI to immediately begin generating responses without showing the opening prompt.

2. **Command Removal**: After processing a `[settime]` command from a storycard, the command is automatically removed from the storycard entry to keep the story clean.

**How It Works**:
- At scenario start (action count ≤ 1), all storycards are scanned for `[settime date time]` commands
- Format: `[settime mm/dd/yyyy time]` (e.g., `[settime 08/15/2024 3:30 pm]`)
- Supports various date separators: `/`, `-`, `.`
- Supports both 2-digit and 4-digit years
- Time formats: `3:30 pm`, `3 pm`, `15:30`, etc.
- Once found and processed, the command is removed from the storycard
- The opening prompt is skipped, and the AI generates the first response immediately

**Use Case**:
This feature is perfect for scenarios where you want to pre-configure the starting time without requiring players to manually enter a `[settime]` command. Simply add `[settime 01/15/2025 8:00 am]` to any storycard entry in your scenario, and players can start playing immediately.

**Example**:
Create a storycard with entry:
```
[settime 12/25/2024 6:00 am]
It's Christmas morning in Victorian London...
```

When the scenario starts, the time is automatically set to December 25, 2024 at 6:00 AM, and the AI begins the story without showing the setup prompt.

**Files Modified**:
- `output.js`: Added storycard scanning and [settime] processing logic at scenario start

### Version 1.0.2 (2025-10-08)
**Bug Fix: Storycard Update and System Message Format (Final Solution)**

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Storycard Not Updating**: User commands ([sleep], [advance], [settime], [reset]) would update `state.currentDate` and `state.currentTime`, but the "Current Date and Time" storycard wouldn't update because changes made in the input hook don't persist to storycards reliably.

2. **Bracketed Messages Ignored by AI**: System messages like `[Advanced 2 hours. New date/time: 08/08/2037 8:01 AM.]` were being ignored by the AI because they looked like user commands in brackets.

3. **Sleep Command Time Initialization**: When using `[sleep]` with Unknown time, the command wasn't properly initializing `startingTime`.

**Solution Implemented**:
Inject the turn time marker `[[00y00m00d06h01n00s]]` directly into system messages, reusing the existing timestamp detection mechanism:

1. **Input Hook**: Adds `[[turntime]]` marker to system messages (e.g., `[SYSTEM] You go to sleep... [[00y00m01d00h00n00s]]`)
2. **Context Hook**: Detects `[[turntime]]` in the last action and uses it directly without adding character-based time
3. **Changed Format**: System messages now use `[SYSTEM]` prefix instead of wrapping entire message in brackets
4. **Fixed [sleep]**: Properly initializes `startingTime` to "8:00 AM" when transitioning from Unknown

**Files Modified**:
- `input.js`: Added `[[turntime]]` markers to all command system messages, updated message format to `[SYSTEM]`
- `context.js`: Added check to use `[[turntime]]` from last action directly when present
- `library.js`: Removed unused pending change functions
- `output.js`: Removed unnecessary pending change check

### Version 1.0.1 (2025-10-08)
**Bug Fix: [sleep] Command Time Initialization**

**Issue**: When using the `[sleep]` command with an Unknown time, the command would set `state.currentTime` to "8:00 AM" but not update `state.startingTime`. This caused subsequent time calculations to fail because `computeCurrent()` would still use `startingTime='Unknown'` and return Unknown time.

**Fix**: Modified the `[sleep]` command to properly initialize time when transitioning from Unknown:
- Reset `state.turnTime` to zero before adding the sleep duration
- Set `state.startingTime` to "8:00 AM" when time is Unknown
- Allow `computeCurrent()` to calculate the correct time based on the new starting time
- This ensures future `[advance]` commands work correctly after using `[sleep]`

**Files Modified**:
- `input.js` (lines 36-45): Updated [sleep] command to initialize startingTime

### Version 1.0.0 (2025-10-03)
Combined System - Initial release

## Overview

This is a combined system that merges **WTG 2.0 Lightweight** (World Time Generator) with **AutoCards** automatic storycard generation. The system ensures WTG runs first to maintain time consistency before AutoCards processes content.

## Core Components

### WTG 2.0 Lightweight
- **Time tracking**: Tracks elapsed time in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- **Command processing**: Handles time-related commands ([settime], [advance], [reset], [sleep])
- **Timestamp injection**: Automatically adds timestamps to storycards
- **Adventure erasing detection**: Handles time jumps when navigating adventure history

### AutoCards
- **Automatic storycard generation**: Creates and updates plot-relevant story cards
- **Entity detection**: Identifies characters, locations, and other entities from story content
- **Memory management**: Maintains and compresses storycard memories
- **Configuration system**: Extensive customization options for card generation

## Execution Order

The combined system executes in this order to ensure compatibility:

1. **Input Hook**: WTG command processing → AutoCards title detection
2. **Context Hook**: WTG time injection → AutoCards context modifications
3. **Output Hook**: WTG timestamps → AutoCards card generation

## WTG Features

### Time Tracking
- **Turn Time**: Tracks elapsed time in `00y00m00d00h00n00s` format
- **Current Date/Time**: Maintains current in-story date and time
- **Character-based advancement**: 1 minute per 700 characters (fixed rate)
- **Automatic timestamp injection**: All storycards get discovery timestamps

### Commands (all enclosed in brackets `[command]`)

#### [settime mm/dd/yyyy time]
Set the starting date and time for your adventure.
- **Format**: `[settime 06/15/2023 3:30 PM]`
- **Date**: mm/dd/yyyy or dd/mm/yyyy (auto-detected)
- **Time**: 12-hour format (3:30 PM) or 24-hour format (15:30)
- **Effect**: Resets turn time to zero, updates all existing timestamps

#### [advance N unit]
Manually advance time by a specified amount.
- **Format**: `[advance 5 hours]`, `[advance 2 days]`, `[advance 3 months]`
- **Units**: hours, days, months, years
- **Effect**: Advances time immediately

#### [reset]
Reset date and time to the most recent mention in story history.
- **Format**: `[reset]`
- **Effect**: Scans history for date/time mentions and resets to most recent

#### [sleep]
Natural language command to sleep to the next morning.
- **Format**: Include "[sleep]" in your action
- **Effect**: Sleep 6-9 hours with random minutes, wake up at 8:00 AM if next day

### System Storycards
- **Current Date and Time**: Displays current date/time and turn time
- **WTG Data**: Stores turn data for adventure erasing detection (internal use only)

## AutoCards Features

### Automatic Storycard Generation
- **Entity Detection**: Automatically identifies and creates cards for characters, locations, etc.
- **Title Detection**: Scans story content for potential card titles
- **Memory Management**: Maintains compressed memories of card information
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents excessive card generation

### Configuration Options
AutoCards includes extensive configuration options via the "Configure Auto-Cards" storycard:
- **Generation Settings**: Card creation cooldown, entry limits, memory compression

- **Preserved Functionality**: All features from both systems remain intact
- **Performance Optimized**: WTG Lightweight provides efficient time tracking

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. Copy all 4 files into your AI Dungeon shared library:
   - `context.js`
   - `input.js`
   - `library.js`
   - `output.js`

2. Start a new adventure or continue an existing one
3. Use `[settime mm/dd/yyyy time]` to set your starting date and time
4. Configure AutoCards via the "Configure Auto-Cards" storycard (appears automatically)

### During Adventure
- **Time Management**: Time advances automatically based on story length
- **Command Usage**: Use WTG commands as needed to adjust time
- **Card Generation**: AutoCards automatically creates relevant storycards
- **Configuration**: Access AutoCards settings through the configuration card

### Best Practices
- Set a starting time at the beginning of your adventure
- Use [advance] for intentional time jumps (travel, waiting)
- Use "[sleep]" when your character sleeps
- Use [reset] if time gets out of sync with story
- Configure AutoCards settings to match your playstyle
- Review generated cards and edit them as needed

## Technical Details

### File Structure
- **library.js** (~6,700 lines): WTG functions + AutoCards function
