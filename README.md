## Overview

The World Time Generator (WTG) is a comprehensive scripting system for AI Dungeon that automatically tracks time progression and manages game entities throughout your adventure. Available in two versions to suit different needs.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Time Tracking**: Time advances based on story length
- **Persistent Date & Time**: Current date and time displayed in storycards
- **Entity Management**: Automatic storycard generation for characters and locations (Full version)
- **Adventure Erasing Detection**: Handles time jumps when rewinding story
- **Turn Data Tracking**: Records adventure history for consistency
- **Highly Configurable**: Multiple settings to customize behavior (Full version)

---

## System Commands

### Universal Commands (All Versions)

These commands work in all versions of WTG:

#### `[settime mm/dd/yyyy time]`
**Set starting date and time**

```
[settime 06/15/2023 8:00 AM]
[settime 12/25/2024 11:30 PM]
[settime 01/01/1900 12:00 am]
```

**NEW: Storycard [settime] Detection (v2.1.23)**
You can also add `[settime]` directly into any storycard entry! When the scenario starts, the script will automatically detect it, set the time, remove the command from the storycard, and skip the opening prompt.

**Example:**
```
[settime 12/25/2024 6:00 am]
It's Christmas morning in Victorian London...
```

**NEW: WTG Time Config Card (v2.1.25) - For Large Scenarios**

For scenarios with hundreds of storycards (900+), embedding `[settime]` in storycards can cause performance issues because the script must scan all cards to find the command. Instead, import the **WTG Time Config** storycard for instant O(1) time initialization.

**How to use:**
1. Import `wtg-time-config-template.json` into your scenario's storycards
2. Edit the "WTG Time Config" card to set your desired starting date and time
3. The script will read time directly from this card without scanning other storycards

**Template format:**
```json
{
  "title": "WTG Time Config",
  "value": "Starting Date: 01/01/2024\nStarting Time: 12:00 PM\nInitialized: true",
  "type": "system"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- O(1) lookup instead of O(n) storycard scan
- Essential for scenarios with 500+ storycards
- Easy to edit directly in AI Dungeon
- Backwards compatible (old scenarios still work)

#### `[advance N unit]`
**Jump forward in time**

```
[advance 5 hours]
[advance 2 days]
[advance 1 month]
[advance 3 years]
```
**Units:** hours, days, months, years

#### `[sleep]`
**Sleep to next morning**
- Advances 6-9 hours + random minutes
- Automatically sets time to next morning

```
[sleep]
```

#### `[reset]`
**Reset to most recent date/time mentioned in story**
- Scans recent history for date/time mentions
- Updates to the most recent found

```
[reset]
```

---

### Scenario Version Only

These additional commands are only available in **WTG 2.0 Scenario**:

#### `[normal]`
**Switch to Normal mode (full features)**
- Enables AI entity generation
- Enables AI-driven time commands
- Enables all configurable settings
- Enables advanced AI prompt injections

```
[normal]
```

#### `[light]`
**Switch to Lightweight mode**
- Disables AI entity generation
- Disables AI prompts
- Fixed time rate only
- Manual storycard control

```
[light]
```

#### **Combined Commands**
You can use multiple commands in a single action:

```
[light] [settime 08/08/2022 6:00 am]    # Set mode + time
[normal] [advance 2 hours]              # Switch mode + advance time
```

---

### AI-Generated Commands (Full Version Only)

When **Enable Dynamic Time** is enabled in the Full Version, the AI can trigger time commands:

#### `(sleep N units)`
**AI initiates sleep**
```
AI: You find a bed and (sleep 8 hours)...
```

#### `(advance N units)`
**AI advances time during narrative**
```
AI: The journey continued and (advance 3 days) later, you arrived...
```

These commands:
- Appear at the start of AI responses
- Are automatically processed by the script
- Are removed from the output (unless Debug Mode is enabled)
- Have cooldown periods to prevent spam
- **Units:** hours, minutes, days, weeks, months, years

---

## Storycard Markers

These markers can be placed inside storycard entries to control timestamp behavior.

### `[e]` - Exclusion Marker

**Exclude a storycard from timestamp injection**

Add `[e]` anywhere in a storycard's entry to permanently exclude it from receiving timestamps. The marker is removed when processed, and the card is added to a "WTG Exclusions" system storycard.

**Usage:**
```
Card Title: Important NPC
Keys: npc, character
Entry: This character should never have timestamps. [e]
```

**Result:**
- The `[e]` marker is removed from the entry
- Card title is added to WTG Exclusions
- No timestamps will ever be injected into this card

**Notes:**
- Case insensitive (`[e]` and `[E]` both work)
- Multiple `[e]` markers are all removed
- If combined with `/]`, the exclusion takes precedence

---

### `/]` - Custom Timestamp Placement

**Control where timestamps are inserted**

Add `/]` anywhere in a storycard's entry to specify where the timestamp should be inserted. The timestamp will be placed directly before `/]` (without a blank line), and the marker is removed after insertion.

**Usage:**
```
Card Title: Marcus the Warrior
Keys: marcus, warrior
Entry: A grizzled veteran with battle scars./]

Additional notes that should appear after the timestamp.
```

**Result (after timestamp injection):**
```
A grizzled veteran with battle scars.Met on 06/15/2023 8:00 AM

Additional notes that should appear after the timestamp.
```

**Notes:**
- If no `/]` marker is present, timestamps are appended at the end with a blank line separator (default behavior)
- The `/]` marker is removed after the timestamp is inserted
- Useful for keeping additional notes or formatting below the timestamp

---

## Which Version Should I Use?

**Overview**

The regular version of WTG 2.0 was tested primarily using Deepseek v3.1, so this script performs best with that model. The lightweight version is primarily for Llama and other smaller models, as they have a hard time with instruction following. Mixtral models can also work with the normal WTG scripts, but I haven't done rigorous testing with those models.

The Scenario version is just a convenient way for mobile users to switch between either script. 

### Choose **WTG 2.0 (Full Version)** if you want:

**Automatic Entity Generation**
- AI automatically creates storycards for characters: `(CharacterName)`
- AI automatically creates storycards for locations: `((LocationName))`
- Description injection: `(((Entity) description text)))`

**Advanced Features**
- AI-driven time commands: `(sleep 8 hours)`, `(advance 2 days)`
- Configurable time multiplier for different story pacing
- Dynamic time adjustment based on action type
- Entity deprecation when no longer detected in the adventure.

### Choose **WTG 2.0 Lightweight** if you want:

**Simple & Clean**
- Just time tracking, nothing else
- No AI prompt interference
- Predictable, consistent behavior

**Performance**
- Minimal overhead
- Faster processing
- Less complexity

**Manual Control**
- You create all storycards manually
- AI never receives entity formatting instructions
- Pure time tracking without any entity features

### Choose **WTG 2.0 Scenario** if you want:

**Maximum Flexibility**
- Switch between full features and lightweight mode anytime
- Start simple, add features as needed
- Try different approaches in the same adventure

**Convenient Setup**
- Mode switching during play: `[normal]` or `[light]`
- Current mode always visible in time display

**Best of Both Worlds**
- Full WTG 2.0 features when you want them
- Lightweight performance when you need it
- Seamless transitions between modes

## WTG 2.0 (Full Version)

**Current Version**: 2.1.25

### Features

#### AI-Driven Entity Generation

The AI automatically formats entity names with parentheses, which triggers automatic storycard creation:

**Characters** (single parentheses):
```
"A warrior named (Marcus) approached the tavern."
Creates storycard for character "Marcus"

"(The Innkeeper) greeted you warmly."
Creates storycard for character "The Innkeeper"
```

**Locations** ((double parentheses)):
```
"You entered ((The Golden Tavern))."
Creates storycard for location "The Golden Tavern"

"The path led to ((Silverwood Forest))."
Creates storycard for location "Silverwood Forest"
```

**Descriptions** (((triple parentheses))):
```
"(((Marcus) A grizzled veteran with a scarred face)))"
Adds description to Marcus's storycard
```

#### Advanced Time Management

- **Base Time**: 1 minute per 700 characters (configurable multiplier)
- **Dynamic Time**: Adjusts based on keyword detection
  - Dialogue scenes: Slower time passage
  - Travel/waiting: Faster time passage
- **AI Commands**: AI can trigger time jumps with `(sleep X units)` or `(advance X units)`
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents AI from repeating time commands too frequently

#### Configuration Settings

Located in "World Time Generator Settings" storycard:

```

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Full Version Tips

1. **Debug Mode**: Enable to see parentheses in output for testing
2. **Time Multiplier**: Adjust to make time pass faster/slower
3. **Entity Deletion**: Disable to keep deprecated entities in storycards
4. **Dynamic Time**: Enable for smarter time passage based on action type

### Lightweight Tips

1. **Pre-create Important Cards**: Create storycards before starting
2. **Use Keys Wisely**: Ensure storycard keys match story mentions
3. **Check Timestamps**: Verify storycards receive timestamps correctly
4. **Manual Sleep**: Use `[sleep]` command when resting

---

## Troubleshooting

### Full Version Issues

**AI not using parentheses?**
- Check "Enable Generated Character Cards" setting
- Verify Debug Mode is false (set to true to see parentheses)
- Review AI Dungeon console logs for errors

**Too many entities created?**
- AI is being too generous with parentheses
- Consider using Lightweight version for manual control
- Or enable "Disable Generated Card Deletion" to keep all cards

**Time moving too fast/slow?**
- Adjust "Time Duration Multiplier" setting
- Enable/disable "Enable Dynamic Time" for automatic adjustment

### Lightweight Issues

**Storycards not getting timestamps?**
- Check that storycard keys match story mentions
- Verify card isn't a system card (WTG Data, Current Date and Time)
- Check console logs for errors

**Time not tracking?**
- Ensure you ran `[settime]` command first
- Check "Current Date and Time" storycard for current time
- Verify scripts are properly installed

### Both Versions

**Nothing working at all?**
- Verify all 4 scripts are copied correctly
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Ensure scenario allows scripting (Simple Start or Character Creator)
- Try `[settime]` command to initialize
