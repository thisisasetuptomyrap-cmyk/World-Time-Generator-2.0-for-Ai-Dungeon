## Overview

The World Time Generator (WTG) is a comprehensive scripting system for AI Dungeon that automatically tracks time progression and manages game entities throughout your adventure. Available in two versions to suit different needs.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Time Tracking**: Time advances based on story length
- **Persistent Date & Time**: Current date and time displayed in storycards
- **Entity Management**: Automatic storycard generation for characters and locations (Full version)
- **Adventure Erasing Detection**: Handles time jumps when rewinding story
- **Turn Data Tracking**: Records adventure history for consistency
- **Highly Configurable**: Multiple settings to customize behavior (Full version)

---

## Which Version Should I Use?

**Overview**

The regular version of WTG 2.0 was tested primarly using Deepseek v3.1, so this script performs best with that model. The lightweight model is primarly for llama and other smaller models, as they have a hard time doing instruction following. Mixtral models can also work with the base wtg scripts, but I haven't done rigorous testing with those models, so be warned. 

### Choose **WTG 2.0 (Full Version)** if you want:

**Automatic Entity Generation**
- AI automatically creates storycards for characters: `(CharacterName)`
- AI automatically creates storycards for locations: `((LocationName))`
- Description injection: `(((Entity) description text)))`

**Advanced Features**
- AI-driven time commands: `(sleep 8 hours)`, `(advance 2 days)`
- Configurable time multiplier for different story pacing
- Dynamic time adjustment based on action type
- Entity deprecation when no longer detected in the adventure.

### Choose **WTG 2.0 Lightweight** if you want:

**Simple & Clean**
- Just time tracking, nothing else
- No AI prompt interference
- Predictable, consistent behavior
- Recommended for free users

**Performance**
- Minimal overhead
- Faster processing
- Less complexity

**Manual Control**
- You create all storycards manually
- AI never receives entity formatting instructions
- Pure time tracking without any entity features

## WTG 2.0 (Full Version)

**Current Version**: 2.1.20  
**Location**: `f:\ai dung scripts\wtg_2.0\`

### Features

#### AI-Driven Entity Generation

The AI automatically formats entity names with parentheses, which triggers automatic storycard creation:

**Characters** (single parentheses):
```
"A warrior named (Marcus) approached the tavern."
Creates storycard for character "Marcus"

"(The Innkeeper) greeted you warmly."
Creates storycard for character "The Innkeeper"
```

**Locations** ((double parentheses)):
```
"You entered ((The Golden Tavern))."
Creates storycard for location "The Golden Tavern"

"The path led to ((Silverwood Forest))."
Creates storycard for location "Silverwood Forest"
```

**Descriptions** (((triple parentheses))):
```
"(((Marcus) A grizzled veteran with a scarred face)))"
Adds description to Marcus's storycard
```

#### Advanced Time Management

- **Base Time**: 1 minute per 700 characters (configurable multiplier)
- **Dynamic Time**: Adjusts based on keyword detection
  - Dialogue scenes: Slower time passage
  - Travel/waiting: Faster time passage
- **AI Commands**: AI can trigger time jumps with `(sleep X units)` or `(advance X units)`
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents AI from repeating time commands too frequently

#### Configuration Settings

Located in "World Time Generator Settings" storycard:

```
Time Duration Multiplier: 1.0          # Adjust time passage speed
Enable Generated Character Cards: true  # Toggle automatic character cards
Enable Generated Location Cards: true   # Toggle automatic location cards
Disable Generated Card Deletion: true   # Prevent card cleanup
Debug Mode: false                       # Show/hide parentheses in output
Enable Dynamic Time: true               # Enable smart time adjustment
Disable WTG Entirely: false            # Emergency disable switch
```

#### Scripts

- **input copy.js**: Processes player commands and input entity markers
- **context copy.js**: Injects AI instructions and manages time
- **output copy.js**: Processes AI output, detects entities, creates storycards
- **library copy.js**: Core utility functions and data management

### What Gets Created Automatically

1. **Character Storycards**: When AI mentions `(CharacterName)`
2. **Location Storycards**: When AI mentions `((LocationName))`
3. **Timestamps**: "Met on [date]" for characters, "Visited [date]" for locations
4. **WTG Data Card**: Internal tracking for turn data and adventure erasing
5. **Current Date and Time Card**: Displays current in-story time
6. **World Time Generator Settings**: Configuration options

**Example Flow:**
```
You: I enter the tavern looking for work.

AI: As you push through the heavy oak doors of ((The Rusty Anchor)), 
     the smell of ale and pipe smoke fills your nostrils. (Garth the 
     Barkeep) looks up from wiping down the counter and nods in your 
     direction.

Storycards created:
   - "The Rusty Anchor" (location)
   - "Garth the Barkeep" (character)
Time advanced by ~2 minutes
Current time updated
```

### Using Lightweight Version

After setup:
- Create storycards manually for important characters/locations
- Time tracks automatically
- Storycards get timestamps when their triggers are mentioned
- No entity formatting or AI instructions

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Full Version Tips

1. **Debug Mode**: Enable to see parentheses in output for testing
2. **Time Multiplier**: Adjust to make time pass faster/slower
3. **Entity Deletion**: Disable to keep deprecated entities in storycards
4. **Dynamic Time**: Enable for smarter time passage based on action type

### Lightweight Tips

1. **Pre-create Important Cards**: Create storycards before starting
2. **Use Keys Wisely**: Ensure storycard keys match story mentions
3. **Check Timestamps**: Verify storycards receive timestamps correctly
4. **Manual Sleep**: Use `[sleep]` command when resting

## Troubleshooting

### Full Version Issues

**AI not using parentheses?**
- Check "Enable Generated Character Cards" setting
- Verify Debug Mode is false (set to true to see parentheses)
- Review AI Dungeon console logs for errors

**Too many entities created?**
- AI is being too generous with parentheses
- Consider using Lightweight version for manual control
- Or enable "Disable Generated Card Deletion" to keep all cards

**Time moving too fast/slow?**
- Adjust "Time Duration Multiplier" setting
- Enable/disable "Enable Dynamic Time" for automatic adjustment

### Lightweight Issues

**Storycards not getting timestamps?**
- Check that storycard keys match story mentions
- Verify card isn't a system card (WTG Data, Current Date and Time)
- Check console logs for errors

**Time not tracking?**
- Ensure you ran `[settime]` command first
- Check "Current Date and Time" storycard for current time
- Verify scripts are properly installed

### Both Versions

**Nothing working at all?**
- Verify all 4 scripts are copied correctly
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Ensure scenario allows scripting (Simple Start or Character Creator)
- Try `[settime]` command to initialize
